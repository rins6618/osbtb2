Operating system by the books and guides across the internet.

It is important to note that these guides are mostly old and non-practical for an actual system.
They have been noted to have some mistakes.
Following these guides closely:

Nick Blundell's book (unfinished): 
https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf

James Molloy's online guide ([old and buggy](https://wiki.osdev.org/James_Molloy%27s_Tutorial_Known_Bugs), yet useful): https://web.archive.org/web/20240105220255/http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/


NOTE: I've had plenty of random issues that I had to fix by essentially forking code from [here.](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial) This is a great guide that also uses both resources above, but it is incomplete. It gives you a nice idea on what happens on the computer.
